### Responsibilities

The host of any event in the library is responsible for setup, cleanup and supplies including food supplies (plates/forks/napkins), moving bookshelves, and arranging furniture.

### Resources
You will have access to library resources including 
- Sonos speakers
- A projector
- Pull-down screen 

All other "supplies" should be personally wrangled or requested from IT. Please _**cc**_ library@olin.edu when making requests to other administrative groups.  

Notify Facilities (facilities@olin.edu) if seating or tables are needed, or if significant library re-organization is necessary.  Our upstairs shelves are on castors, but they are _**heavy**_.  These requests should be made by placing a [Work Order](https://app.webtma.net/GenerateRequest.aspx?key=8fMN5Hy6FyxarCurPZiqeTCxGg7U4E25%2fTi8Vlue5RMMiBfVfoDCswiaJa8ifcWq).   Facilities will respond with confirmation of receipt. If food is involved, please let facilities know you'll likely need vacuuming or special trash attention.  


### Event Setup

The host of any event in the Library is reponsible for setup and prompt take down of the event.  Please allocate plenty of time to find everything you need and get everything ready.  If the event will be set up more than an hour beforehand, please let us know in your email to the Library. 


### The Quiet Reading Room

During the academic year, the Quiet Reading Room is not available for events.  We recognize it's a pleasant space to congregate, and apologize for the inconvenience, but it is of utmost importance for us to defend a first class study environment.  

During Vacations and Summer, it may be available, email us to chat.
