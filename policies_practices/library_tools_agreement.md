### Circulation Policy

The circulation period for media equipment (all cameras, lenses, field recording devices, lighting) and power drills is 24 hours. Use of equipment for longer than 1 day requires prior approval, in writing, from library staff. Email library@olin.edu to request and confirm.

### Training

- The following tools require training before you can check them out:
- Panasonic GH4, GH5 (non-circulating) and lenses
- DJI Ronin M motorized gimbal
- DJI Osmo
- Zoom F4 Field recorder and microphones (Lavalier and Shotgun)
- DocLab F8 and F-Controller (non-circulating)

Basic training will cover the use and care of equipment. You may also schedule NINJA or Librarian consultation time to discuss your specific project details.

All other items can be checked out freely for you to use and experiment with! 

### Checkout Procedures

All media equipment should have a barcode and each individual piece has an entry in our library catalog.

If you do not see a barcode on an item, please consult a NINJA or librarian before removing the item from the library. 

When checking out equipment, please scan each barcode individually. In practice, that means you will checkout a camera body and camera lens, separately. Small items, like lens caps, are not cataloged and therefore do not need to be scanned, however, please be mindful of their whereabouts when using the gear!

There are some exceptions, like the GoPro Kit, that have one barcode for the entire package. When using the GoPro kit, you are responsible for the entire bag, not just the part you want to use.

***Statement on SD Cards*** The library makes limited numbers of SD cards available for student, faculty and staff use, however, we do not make any guarantee that your data will be preserved after you return your equipment to us. You are solely responsible for the preservation of your data. It is our policy to format (ie. delete) SD cards as part of our equipment maintenance plan. Please be sure to copy your data to a personal hard drive or other cloud storage option before returning your items.

### Care and Use of Equipment

In process.
