# Code of conduct for events sponsored by the Olin Library

The Olin library is fseommitted to an inclusive, collaborative, caring and respectful community environment. We also are dedicated to providing and supporting conference and event experiences that offer extraordinary and joyful learning experiences for everyone, and we strongly promote similar expectations at venues other than our own. Feedback on your experience at an MIT Libraries-sponsored event is welcomed as an opportunity for continuous learning and towards meeting our goals of inclusion and equity.

## Behaviors not tolerated

We do not tolerate harassment or disrespect of event participants in any form. Sexual or discriminatory language and imagery are not appropriate for any event venue, including all presentations, discussions, and associated social events. Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual and or discriminatory images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Note that the Library Use Policy applies to any events taking place in library spaces. MIT Policy on Harassment

## What you can do & how we will respond

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or immediate expulsion from the event. Participants who are asked by anyone to stop any harassing or disrespectful behavior are expected to comply immediately. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact the event organizer or speak with any MIT Libraries staff person associated with the event. Event staff can be identified by their name badges, and will help participants contact security or local law enforcement as appropriate, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference.
