            <h2 class="pv3 f3" id="access-to-resources">Access to Resources</h2>
            <p class=" lh-copy">The Library selects, acquires and manages a breadth of digital and physical resources to strenghten the scholarship and creativity of our community.  Resources include books, databases, select tools, cameras, ebooks, journals and more. That said, our collection is small, and quite focused on the STEM domain. Offsetting this less-than-balanced diet, Olin students enjoy lending priviledges with both Babson College Library and Wellesley College Library.</p>


            <h2 class="pv3 f3" id="access-to-services">Access to Services</h2>
            <p class="lh-copy">The Library offers services across a breadth of domains. Some are turn-key, others are completely context dependant and flourish through deep collaboration.</p>

            <h2 class="pv3 f3" id="research-and-reference-instruction">Research & Reference Instruction</h2>
            <p class="lh-copy">We offer Acadmic Research appointments to help steer Students, Faculty and Staff towards the most relevant resources we have or can get.  Email Library@Olin.edu to contact both Emily and Maggie, both of whom are terrific starting points and will follow-up individually based on the nature and timeline on the inquiry.</p>
            <p class="lh-copy">To derive maximum value from our available information resources, we provide a range of instructional services. We also oversee the instruction and training procedures for the variety of tools we have. From the vinyl cutter to the camera rig, the screen printer to the printing press (coming soon!) - many of our tools require training to use.  In these instances we manage the training of the “trainers,” who then become the front line.</p>
            <p class="lh-copy">Micro master classes, past examples include Portfolio Design/Review with Jeff and Photography with Emily, are something we have experimented with. This represents an area of opportunity.</p>

              <h2 class="pv3 f3" id="programming">Programming</h2>

            <p class="lh-copy">The Library hosts a range of programming.  Examples include: SLAC (Stay Late and Create) on Wednesday nights, faculty retreats, workshops, concerts, petting zoos etc.  These events have been produced by members from all corners of the institution, including the library.</p>
            <p class="lh-copy">See our Events Policy (appendix)</p>

            <h2 class="pv3 f3" id="institutional-archive">Institutional Archive</h2>
            <p class="lh-copy">The Library is the home of the Institional Archive.  We preserve and catalog the cornucopia the scholarship, curricular materials, projects and realia that make Olin what it is.  We maintain both a physical archive in the Lower Level of the Library and a Digital Archive, in the form of our Digital Repository.</p>


            <h2 class="pv3 f3" id="collaborations">Collaborations & Co-Productions</h2>
            <p class="lh-copy">The Library works with select clubs and passionate community members to help host and launch projects, events and cultural artifacts.  These have included the ACRONYM Coffee Shop (4th year), SLAC (4th year), SLACfest (3rd Year), Aquaponics, Hacking Hygene and others.  Collaborations & Co-Productions often use Library Resources, so they follow an application process and are held to a high standard of execution.</p>
